    <h3>window.onload vs document.onload</h3>
    <div>
        <h4>window.onload</h4>

        By default, it is fired when the entire page loads, including its content (images, css, scripts, etc.)
        
        In some browsers it now takes over the role of document.onload and fires when the DOM is ready as well.

        <h4>document.onload</h4>

        It is called when the DOM is ready which can be prior to images and other external content is loaded.

        How well are they supported?

        window.onload appears to be the most widely supported. In fact, 
        some of the most modern browsers have in a sense replaced document.onload with window.onload. 
        Browser support issues are most likely the reason why many people are starting to use libraries 
        such as jQuery to handle the checking for the document being ready.

    <h3>Change the URL in the browser without loading the new page using JavaScript</h3>
    <pre>
        /*

        If you want it to work in browsers that don't support history.pushState and history.popState yet, 
        the "old" way is to set the fragment identifier, which won't cause a page reload.

        The basic idea is to set the window.location.hash property to a value that contains whatever state information you need,
         then either use the window.onhashchange event, or for older browsers that don't support onhashchange (IE < 8, Firefox < 3.6),
          periodically check to see if the hash has changed (using setInterval for example) and update the page.
           You will also need to check the hash value on page load to set up the initial content.

        If you're using jQuery there's a hashchange plugin that will use whichever method the browser supports.
         I'm sure there are plugins for other libraries as well.

        One thing to be careful of is colliding with ids on the page, 
        because the browser will scroll to any element with a matching id.

    <h3>How to access the correct `this` / context inside a callback?</h3>
    <pre>
    /*
    this (aka "the context") is a special keyword inside each function and its value only depends on how the function was called,
    not how/when/where it was defined. It is not affected by lexical scope, like other variables. Here are some examples:
    */

    function foo() {
        console.log(this);
    }

    // normal function call
    foo(); // `this` will refer to `window`

    // as object method
    var obj = {bar: foo};
    obj.bar(); // `this` will refer to `obj`

    // as constructor function
    new foo(); // `this` will refer to an object that inherits from `foo.prototype`

    /*
    To learn more about this, have a look at the MDN documentation.
    */

    /*
     # How to refer to the correct this

     ## Don't use this

    You actually don't want to access this in particular, 
    but the object it refers to. That's why an easy solution is to simply create a new variable that also refers to that object. 
    The variable can have any name, but common ones are self and that.
    */
    
    function MyConstructor(data, transport) {
        this.data = data;
        var self = this;
        transport.on('data', function() {
            alert(self.data);
        });
    }

    /*
    Since self is a normal variable, it obeys lexical scope rules and is accessible inside the callback. 
    This also has the advantage that you can access the this value of the callback itself.

    ## Explicitly set this of the callback - part 1

    It might look like you have no control over the value of this, because its value is set automatically, but that is actually not the case.

    Every function has the method .bind [docs], which returns a new function with this bound to a value. 
    The function has exactly the same behavior as the one you called .bind on, only that this was set by you. 
    No matter how or when that function is called, this will always refer to the passed value.
    */

    function MyConstructor(data, transport) {
        this.data = data;
        var boundFunction = (function() { // parenthesis are not necessary
            alert(this.data);             // but might improve readability
        }).bind(this); // <- here we are calling `.bind()` 
        transport.on('data', boundFunction);
    }

    /*
    In this case, we are binding the callback's this to the value of MyConstructor's this.

    Note: When binding context for jQuery, use jQuery.proxy [docs] instead. 
    The reason to do this is so that you don't need to store the reference to the function when unbinding an event callback. 
    jQuery handles that internally. 

    ## ECMAScript 6: Use arrow functions

    ECMASCript 6 introduces arrow functions, which can be thought of as lambda functions. 
    They don't have their own this binding. Instead, this is looked up in scope just like a normal variable. 
    That means you don't have to call .bind. That's not the only special behavior they have, 
    please refer to the MDN documentation for more information. 
    */

    function MyConstructor(data, transport) {
        this.data = data;
        transport.on('data', () => alert(this.data));
    }

    /*
    ## Set this of the callback - part 2

    Some functions/methods which accept callbacks also accept a value to which the callback's this should refer to. 
    This is basically the same as binding it yourself, but the function/method does it for you. 
    Array#map [docs] is such a method. Its signature is:
    */

    array.map(callback[, thisArg])

    /*
    The first argument is the callback and the second argument is the value this should refer to. Here is a contrived example:
    */
    
    var arr = [1, 2, 3];
    var obj = {multiplier: 42};

    var new_arr = arr.map(function(v) {
        return v * this.multiplier;
    }, obj); // <- here we are passing `obj` as second argument


    /*
    Note: Whether or not you can pass a value for this is usually mentioned in the documentation of that function/method. For example,
    jQuery's $.ajax method [docs] describes an option called context:
    This object will be made the context of all Ajax-related callbacks.


    ## Common problem: Using object methods as callbacks / event handlers

    Another common manifestation of this problem is when an object method is used as callback / event handler. 
    Functions are first class citizens in JavaScript and the term "method" is just a colloquial term for a function that is a value of an object property. 
    But that function doesn't have a specific link to its "containing" object.

    Consider the following example:
    */

    function Foo() {
        this.data = 42,
        document.body.onclick = this.method;
    }

    Foo.prototype.method = function() {
        console.log(this.data);
    };

    /*
    The function this.method is assigned as click event handler, but if the body is clicked, the value logged will be undefined, 
    because inside the event handler, this refers to the body, not the instance of Foo.
    As already mentioned at the beginning, what this refers to depends on how the function is called, not how it is defined.
    If the code was like the following, it might be more obvious that the function doesn't have an implicit reference to the object:
    */

    function method() {
        console.log(this.data);
    }


    function Foo() {
        this.data = 42,
        document.body.onclick = this.method;
    }

    Foo.prototype.method = method;

    /*
    The solution is the same as mentioned above: If available, use .bind to explicitly bind this to a specific value
    */

    document.body.onclick = this.method.bind(this);

    /*
    or explicitly call the function as a "method" of the object, 
    by using an anonymous function has callback / event handler and assign the object (this) to another variable:
    */

    var self = this;
    document.body.onclick = function() {
        self.method();
    };

    /*
    or use an arrow function:
    */

    document.body.onclick = () => this.method();
